### Brief
Create 2 text files and 2 jupyter notebook files to record progress and exploration of the Scikit-learn python library, as well as the scipy.stats function.  The two text files to be included in th the document are a readme.md file - explaining how the notebooks are to be run, as well as a requirements.txt file to outline any special arrangments that need to be inplace for the notebooks to be run successfully.

### Introduction 
The purpose of this README.md file is to provide guidance on navigating the Jupyter Notebooks for this module. The notebooks were completed to comply with the brief outlined above.

The README.md file is divided in to a number of different segments namely;

1. Introduction
2. Scikit-learn.ipynb
3. Scipy-stats.ipynb
4. Other documentation
5. Conclusion
6. Refrences

The refrences used throughout the notebook are outlined in section 6. Throughout the notebooks footnotes are used to indicate where the specific refrences are used.

The notebooks themselves will contain a number of cells with the python code included.  Each example used will contain sample code to explain how the algoritm works, as well as code from the choosen dataset to demonstrate the algorithm in action.
