# Machine Learning and Statistics
Submitted by Sinead Duffy, ID:10016151
***

## Brief
Create 2 text files and 2 jupyter notebook files to record progress and exploration of the Scikit-learn python library, as well as the scipy.stats function.  The two text files to be included in th the document are a readme.md file - explaining how the notebooks are to be run, as well as a requirements.txt file to outline any special arrangments that need to be inplace for the notebooks to be run successfully.

***

## Contents of the Repository
The repository contains the following;
- Scikit-learn.ipynb
	- Jupyter notebook which contains the explaination and examples of the Scikit-learn package
- Scipy-stats.ipynb
	- 2nd Jupyter notebook containing an explanation of the SciPy.Stats program and an example of a one-way ANOVA.
- README.md
	- this file with instructions on how to run the notebooks
- requirement.txt
	- outlines the programs needed to run the notebooks
- .gitignore file

Files contained in the folder include;
- Datasets Folder
	- heart.csv 
		- UCI Machine Learning Repository - Heart Diease dataset
	- video.csv
		- video_data_descrtion.docx
- Images Folder 
	- contains images used in the python notebooks
- Other files 
	-	contains other files used in the creation of the notebooks, test of Gaussian output / Install Tabulate etc.

## Structure of Jupyter Notebooks
Each of the Jupyter notebooks contain the following structure

1. Introduction
2. Explanation of the relevant package
3. Example of the relevant package at work
4. Other information (as relevant)
5. Conclusion
6. Refrences

The refrences used throughout the notebooks are outlined in section 6. Throughout the notebooks footnotes are used to indicate where the specific refrences are used.

The notebooks themselves will contain a number of cells with the python code included.  Each example used will contain sample code to explain how the algoritm works, as well as code from the choosen dataset to demonstrate the algorithm in action.

## Viewing the Jupyter Notebooks

### Option 1 - Run the Notebooks from the Command Line
To run the code in this repository, Python 3 must be installed, and can be downloaded at  https://www.python.org/downloads/

Otherwise, the Anaconda Python distribution can be used, and is freely available to download at  https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/

### Option 2 - View the Notebooks in a Browser
As an alternative to installing software on your PC, it is possible to view the contents of the Jupyter Notebooks can be viewed in the internet browser using the link https://github.com/sinduff/MLS_Assign and selecting the relevnat file.

### Option 3 - View the Notebooks in NBViewer
