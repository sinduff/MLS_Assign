    "Scikit-learn is a library within Python that allows for machine learning scenarios to be completed using regression / classifification as well as clustering.[^1] [^2] The library draws on other packages / libraries such as NumPy, Matplotlib, Pandas etc in to improve functionality.[^3]  \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "The scikit-learn library allows developers to use supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms to test data that is loaded using a .csv file (in the case of this noteook).  Within supervised learning 17 distinct areas are outlined, such as linear models, kernel ridge regression, stochastic gradient descent, nearest neighbours and decision tress.[^1]        Unsupervisied learning has 9 distinct areas such as Gaussian mixture models, manifold learning, clustering and biclustering.[^1]\n",
